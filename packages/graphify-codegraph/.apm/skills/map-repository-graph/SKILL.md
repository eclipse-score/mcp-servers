# Map Repository Graph Skill

Use this skill to understand your repository structure without exhausting context.

## Prerequisites: Graph Setup

Before using this skill, call the `apm-setup` MCP tools for the target repository:

```bash
verify_setup(repo_path)
setup_graphify(repo_path)
```

Verify that setup created `graphify-out/graph.json` before querying the graph.

## When to invoke

- Understanding what files/modules exist and how they relate
- Finding where a symbol (function, class, interface) is defined
- Tracing dependencies and call chains
- Identifying which files need to be modified for a task
- Understanding code organization and ownership

## How to use

1. **Define your query scope** (whole repo, specific directory, specific pattern?)
2. **Ask about the graph layer** you need (structure, symbols, dependencies, ownership?)
3. **Get back a map** (not source code—just relationships and metadata)
4. **Identify relevant nodes** from the map
5. **Read only what's relevant** using line-range file reads

## Example queries

```
Query scope: src/api/
Graph layer: symbols + dependencies
Question: Show me all functions in this directory and what they call
```

```
Query scope: entire repo
Graph layer: ownership
Question: What are the main module boundaries and who owns each?
```

```
Query scope: /utils/
Graph layer: structure + dependencies
Question: Map all files and show reverse dependencies (what imports these files?)
```

## What you get

- Repository structure overview (not source code)
- Symbol lists with signatures
- Dependency graphs or dependency matrices
- Ownership information
- File metadata (size, complexity metrics if available)

## Integration with Working Memory

When using context-discipline working memory:

```python
# Session starts with goal
wm.initialize_session(
    goal="Understand authentication flow",
    subgoals=["Find auth entry points", "Trace to database"]
)

# Query the graph via working memory
auth_nodes = wm.query_graph("All functions related to authentication")
# ↓ Delegates to graphify-codegraph MCP
# ↓ Reads graphify-out/graph.json
# ↓ Returns relevant symbols + files

# Use results to guide file reads
wm.record_decision(
    decision="Read auth.py and api/login.py",
    reason=["Graph results identify the relevant files"],
)
```

## Refreshing the Graph

During development, refresh if code changes significantly:

```bash
cd /path/to/repo
rm -rf graphify-out/
graphify .
```

MCP automatically reads the new graph on next query—no restart needed.

## Pro tips

- **Narrow your scope** — Query specific directories, not everything
- **Layer by layer** — Start with structure, then dive into symbols you care about
- **Follow reverse deps** — Find what calls a function, then read those callers
- **Use ownership** — Find the maintainer of a module before making breaking changes
- **Refresh if stale** — If you find files missing, regenerate the graph

## Next step

Once you have the graph map, use targeted file reads (with line ranges) to examine only the relevant source code.
