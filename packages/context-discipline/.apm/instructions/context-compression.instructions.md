# Context Compression Guidelines

Every tool output risks exhausting your context window. Compress before re-inserting.

## The Rule

**Never paste raw tool output into working memory.**

Always: Query → Compress → Summarize → Re-insert compressed summary

## Compression patterns by tool type

### File reads

```
BEFORE (raw output):
[200 lines of source code]

AFTER (compressed):
- File: lib/auth.py (lines 50-75)
- Purpose: authenticate() function
- Key finding: Uses synchronous time.sleep() for backoff; needs async conversion
- Related: Called by api/handlers.py:87, cli/commands.py:42
- Status: Ready for refactoring
```

### Graph queries

```
BEFORE (raw output):
[Large dependency matrix with 50+ files]

AFTER (compressed):
- Scope: src/api/ directory
- 12 files total
- Internal dependencies: handlers.py → services.py → models.py (clean chain)
- External imports: 3 files import external libraries
- Ownership: team/backend owns all
- Key insight: Single dependency chain, no circular deps
```

### API/docs queries

```
BEFORE (raw output):
[10 pages of FastAPI documentation]

AFTER (compressed):
- Query: FastAPI dependency injection pattern
- Key: Use Depends() function to inject dependencies
- Signature: async def handler(db: Session = Depends(get_db))
- Example: [minimal working example, 5 lines max]
- Note: Dependency is evaluated per-request
- Version: FastAPI 0.104+
```

### Error messages

```
BEFORE (raw output):
[Full stack trace with 20+ frames]

AFTER (compressed):
- Error: TypeError: cannot index into None type
- Location: models.py:42 in User.get_email()
- Cause: user.profile can be None; code assumes it's always set
- Context: Happens when user record incomplete
- Fix strategy: Add defensive check or update schema requirement
```

## Compression checklist

- [ ] **Removed noise** — Eliminated irrelevant details, boilerplate, examples I don't need
- [ ] **Extracted signal** — Pulled out 3-5 key facts that matter for the task
- [ ] **Noted the source** — Can I reference the original if the model needs full details?
- [ ] **Fit in 3-4 lines** — Can I state this compressed finding in 3-4 bullets?
- [ ] **Actionable** — Does this compression give me enough info to proceed?

## When to break the rule

You can include more detail if:

1. The information is **highly relevant** to an immediate decision
2. The **model has context budget** available
3. The information is **impossible to summarize further** without losing essential meaning
4. You're in an **early exploration phase** (before you've narrowed scope)

Even then: compress 50% and provide a reference link/path to full details.

## Update compressed findings as you learn

```yaml
findings:
  from_tools:
    - tool: file-read
      query: "lib/auth.py:50-75"
      result: "authenticate() uses sync time.sleep(); needs async conversion"
      timestamp: "2026-08-13T10:40:00Z"
    # Later, you read related code:
    - tool: file-read
      query: "cli/commands.py:42 (caller of authenticate)"
      result: "CLI also uses sync auth; async conversion requires new CLI event loop"
      timestamp: "2026-08-13T10:50:00Z"
      dependency: "Blocks authenticate() conversion; must handle together"
```

Track dependencies between compressed findings. This prevents forgotten blockers.
