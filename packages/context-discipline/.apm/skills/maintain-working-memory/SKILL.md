# Maintain Working Memory Skill

Use the `context-discipline` MCP tools to track your session explicitly without custom YAML maintenance.

Simple, self-contained implementation. Works standalone. Designed to integrate with Phase 2 LocalObservationManager without breaking changes.

## When to invoke

- **Starting a session** — Initialize working memory with goals
- **After tool calls** — Record compressed findings (1-2 sentences)
- **Before major decisions** — Check unverified assumptions and stale artifacts
- **When making decisions** — Record with reversibility tracking
- **Regularly** — Update plan and coverage as you learn

## How to use

### Setup: Initialize working memory

```python
wm.initialize_session(
    goal="Refactor auth module to async",
    subgoals=[
        "Identify all auth functions",
        "Map dependencies on sync calls",
        "Implement async versions",
        "Update call sites"
    ],
    assumptions=["auth.py is the only auth module"]
)
```

### Record compressed findings

```python
# After each tool call, record (COMPRESS to 1-2 sentences)
wm.query_graph("All functions in lib/auth.py")
```

### Track assumptions

```python
# Add assumptions (especially ones to verify)
wm.initialize_session(
    goal="Track assumptions",
    subgoals=[],
    assumptions={"auth.py is only auth module": "high", "No external code imports auth": "medium"},
)

# Before risky decisions, check for unverified ones
unverified = wm.get_unverified_assumptions()
if unverified:
    print(f"WARNING: {len(unverified)} unverified assumptions")
    for a in unverified:
        if a.confidence in ["low", "medium"]:
            print(f"  - {a.key} (confidence: {a.confidence}) - VERIFY BEFORE PROCEEDING")
```

### Record decisions

```python
# Document what you decide and why (with reversibility)
wm.record_decision(
    decision="Implement async in auth.py first, then update callers",
    reason=[
        "Minimizes risk of partial refactoring",
        "Only 3 call sites to update",
        "Can test refactored functions independently"
    ],
    reversible=True
)
```

### Update progress

```python
# After each major step, update your plan
wm.record_outcome(
    task="Map all call sites of authenticate()",
    verdict="pass",
    coverage=0.35,
    surfaced_nodes=["authenticate"],
    missing_nodes=[],
)
```

### Review before major decisions

```python
# Get current state
state = wm.get_working_memory()
print(f"Entries: {len(state)}")

# Check for potential issues
unverified = wm.get_unverified_assumptions()

if unverified:
    print(f"WARNING: {len(unverified)} unverified assumptions")
```

## Current API

The six MCP tools are the complete current API: `initialize_session`,
`query_graph`, `record_decision`, `record_outcome`, `get_working_memory`, and
`get_unverified_assumptions`. Working memory is held for the running server
session; completed outcomes are persisted to `.score-local/observations.jsonl`.

## Automatic Benefits

- ✅ **Zero custom guardrail code** — Reuses tested infrastructure
- ✅ **Immutable audit trail** — JSONL append-only logs
- ✅ **Fast queries** — O(1) lookups via session index
- ✅ **Importance/coverage filtering** — Automatic signal vs. noise detection
- ✅ **No maintenance burden** — Simple Python class, no YAML to maintain
- ✅ **Global learning ready** — Integrates with Phase 2 experience aggregation
